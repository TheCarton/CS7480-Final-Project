# CS7480-Final-Project

This is an implementation of a probablistic programming language called SimPPL, completed for Professor Steven Holtzen's Probalistic Programming Languages class, CS 7480.

This program takes SimPPL code as input, and returns the probability of the program returning true. For an example of a SimPPL program, please see rifleman.txt.
